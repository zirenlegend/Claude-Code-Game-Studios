## Why This Exists

Building a game solo with AI is powerful — but a single chat session has no structure. No one stops you from hardcoding magic numbers, skipping design docs, or writing spaghetti code. There's no QA pass, no design review, no one asking "does this actually fit the game's vision?"

**Claude Code Game Studios** solves this by giving your AI session the structure of a real studio. Instead of one general-purpose assistant, you get 48 specialized agents organized into a studio hierarchy — directors who guard the vision, department leads who own their domains, and specialists who do the hands-on work. Each agent has defined responsibilities, escalation paths, and quality gates.

The result: you still make every decision, but now you have a team that asks the right questions, catches mistakes early, and keeps your project organized from first brainstorm to launch.

## What's Included

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Agents** | 54 | Specialized subagents across design, programming, art, audio, narrative, QA, and production |
| **Skills** | 37 | Slash commands for common workflows (`/start`, `/sprint-plan`, `/code-review`, `/brainstorm`, etc.) |
| **Hooks** | 8 | Automated validation on commits, pushes, asset changes, session lifecycle, agent audit, and gap detection |

## Studio Hierarchy

Agents are organized into three tiers, matching how real studios operate:

```
Tier 1 — Directors (Opus)
  creative-director    technical-director    producer

Tier 2 — Department Leads (Sonnet)
  game-designer        lead-programmer       art-director
  audio-director       narrative-director    qa-lead
  release-manager      localization-lead

Tier 3 — Specialists (Sonnet/Haiku)
  gameplay-programmer  engine-programmer     ai-programmer
  network-programmer   tools-programmer      ui-programmer
  systems-designer     level-designer        economy-designer
  technical-artist     sound-designer        writer
  world-builder        ux-designer           prototyper
  performance-analyst  devops-engineer       analytics-engineer
  security-engineer    qa-tester             accessibility-specialist
  live-ops-designer    community-manager
```

### Engine Specialists

The template includes agent sets for all four major engines. Use the set that matches your project:

| Engine | Lead Agent | Sub-Specialists |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Godot 4** | `godot-specialist` | GDScript, Shaders, GDExtension |
| **Unity** | `unity-specialist` | DOTS/ECS, Shaders/VFX, Addressables, UI Toolkit |
| **Unreal Engine 5** | `unreal-specialist` | GAS, Blueprints, Replication, UMG/CommonUI |
| **Cocos Creator 3.x** | `cocos-specialist` | TypeScript, Shaders, UI, Native Extension, Asset Management |

## Slash Commands

**Team Orchestration** (coordinate multiple agents on a single feature)
`/team-combat` `/team-narrative` `/team-ui` `/team-release` `/team-polish` `/team-audio` `/team-level`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- **Recommended**: [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (for hook validation) and Python 3 (for JSON validation)

All hooks fail gracefully if optional tools are missing — nothing breaks, you just lose validation.

### Setup

1. **Clone or use as template**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Donchitos/Claude-Code-Game-Studios.git my-game
   cd my-game
   ```

2. **Open Claude Code** and start a session:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **Run `/start`** — the system asks where you are (no idea, vague concept,
   clear design, existing work) and guides you to the right workflow. No assumptions.

   Or jump directly to a specific skill if you already know what you need:
   - `/brainstorm` — explore game ideas from scratch
   - `/setup-engine godot 4.6` — configure your engine if you already know
   - `/project-stage-detect` — analyze an existing project

## Upgrading

Already using an older version of this template? See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md)
for step-by-step migration instructions, a breakdown of what changed between
versions, and which files are safe to overwrite vs. which need a manual merge.

```

## How It Works

### Agent Coordination

Agents follow a structured delegation model:

1. **Vertical delegation** — directors delegate to leads, leads delegate to specialists
2. **Horizontal consultation** — same-tier agents can consult each other but can't make binding cross-domain decisions
3. **Conflict resolution** — disagreements escalate up to the shared parent (`creative-director` for design, `technical-director` for technical)
4. **Change propagation** — cross-department changes are coordinated by `producer`
5. **Domain boundaries** — agents don't modify files outside their domain without explicit delegation

### Collaborative, Not Autonomous

This is **not** an auto-pilot system. Every agent follows a strict collaboration protocol:

1. **Ask** — agents ask questions before proposing solutions
2. **Present options** — agents show 2-4 options with pros/cons
3. **You decide** — the user always makes the call
4. **Draft** — agents show work before finalizing
5. **Approve** — nothing gets written without your sign-off

You stay in control. The agents provide structure and expertise, not autonomy.

### Automated Safety

**Hooks** run automatically on every session:

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `validate-commit.sh` | `git commit` | Checks for hardcoded values, TODO format, JSON validity, design doc sections |
| `validate-push.sh` | `git push` | Warns on pushes to protected branches |
| `validate-assets.sh` | File writes in `assets/` | Validates naming conventions and JSON structure |
| `session-start.sh` | Session open | Loads sprint context and recent git activity |
| `detect-gaps.sh` | Session open | Detects fresh projects (suggests `/start`) and missing documentation when code/prototypes exist |
| `pre-compact.sh` | Context compression | Preserves session progress notes |
| `session-stop.sh` | Session close | Logs accomplishments |
| `log-agent.sh` | Agent spawned | Audit trail of all subagent invocations |

**Permission rules** in `settings.json` auto-allow safe operations (git status, test runs) and block dangerous ones (force push, `rm -rf`, reading `.env` files).

### Path-Scoped Rules

Coding standards are automatically enforced based on file location:

| Path | Enforces |
|------|----------|
| `src/gameplay/**` | Data-driven values, delta time usage, no UI references |
| `src/core/**` | Zero allocations in hot paths, thread safety, API stability |
| `src/ai/**` | Performance budgets, debuggability, data-driven parameters |
| `src/networking/**` | Server-authoritative, versioned messages, security |
| `src/ui/**` | No game state ownership, localization-ready, accessibility |
| `design/gdd/**` | Required 8 sections, formula format, edge cases |
| `tests/**` | Test naming, coverage requirements, fixture patterns |
| `prototypes/**` | Relaxed standards, README required, hypothesis documented |

## Design Philosophy

This template is grounded in professional game development practices:

- **MDA Framework** — Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics analysis for game design
- **Self-Determination Theory** — Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness for player motivation
- **Flow State Design** — Challenge-skill balance for player engagement
- **Bartle Player Types** — Audience targeting and validation
- **Verification-Driven Development** — Tests first, then implementation

## Customization

This is a **template**, not a locked framework. Everything is meant to be customized:

- **Add/remove agents** — delete agent files you don't need, add new ones for your domains
- **Edit agent prompts** — tune agent behavior, add project-specific knowledge
- **Modify skills** — adjust workflows to match your team's process
- **Add rules** — create new path-scoped rules for your project's directory structure
- **Tune hooks** — adjust validation strictness, add new checks
- **Pick your engine** — use the Godot, Unity, or Unreal agent set (or none)

## Platform Support

Tested on **Windows 10** with Git Bash. All hooks use POSIX-compatible patterns (`grep -E`, not `grep -P`) and include fallbacks for missing tools. Works on macOS and Linux without modification.
